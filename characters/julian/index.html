<p><em>“There’s nothing wrong with a man acknowledging his awesomeness&hellip;”</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Julian was born in Londinium and grew up in Heister with his older brother Benedict. His parents are powerful sorcerers that were part of the VOTHD and supposedly they were demon slayers too before Julian and Benedict were born.</p>
<p>Julian was kind of a family prodigy, born sorcerer unlike his brother who&rsquo;s a wizard and had to study hard to get his powers. This fact made Julian naturally arrogant and egoistic, and he constantly insults his brother as a result to this day. Despite this, Benedict is still trying to get on Julian&rsquo;s good side in hopes of improving their relationship. Julian went to School of Evocation with Benedict and Kevin. Julian works mainly alone and has many criminal contacts despite not being a criminal himself. He also has an affiliation with VOTHD because of his parents, although he&rsquo;s not an official member.</p>

<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p><em>Dora: I’ll guess. Is it Julian’s doing?</em></p>
<p><em>Ari: Julian is the-</em></p>
<p><em>Julian: The handsome sorcerer. Yes.</em></p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong> Intelligent, Reckless, Arrogant but Unbothered by many things, Confident, Always has to have the last word, Resourceful, Self-absorbed at times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Motivations:</strong> Seems keen on gaining knowledge and power especially in fields like Arcane Arts but not necessarily in order to get recognition and success, he’s just naturally curious about his own nature and the world</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ben</strong> : his older brother and sole nemesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dora</strong>: frenemy but also one of the few people who happened to stick around him for the long run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jackaby</strong>: kind of a friend, partner in crime (literally and figuratively)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mentor</strong>: his teacher and a role model</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recklessness-and-living-on-edge">Recklessness and living on “edge”</h3>
<p>Julian has shown over the years some very much reckless tendencies, throwing himself constantly into dangerous situations for no reason other than curiosity, low self-preservation and very much reversed priorities. Where other people care about their safety and safety of others, Julian cares about gaining knowledge. Even though he has high-quality education and comes from a privileged family, instead of working a job or being part of a research he’s always been sort of a freelancer, never working a stable job - his current housing situation is an “abandoned” house he won in a card game which could have cost him his liver.</p>
<p>These traits can also be showcased through his long-term drug abuse. While he rarely ever indulges in alcohol, he seems to have affinity for marijuana, morphine and cocaine. He thinks of himself as a recreational user, mostly abusing substances out of boredom or curiosity, but he’s been shown to turn to them after enduring stressful situations as well.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p><em>Julian: I’m Julian. Last name’s not important. And I’m the best sorcerer in the whole world. Well, TOP 3 at least. And the pale skin is just part of my natural god-like beauty.</em></p>
<p><em>Dora: No, I’m pretty sure the pale skin means you’re bleeding out.</em></p>
<h3 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h3>
<p>Even though Julian’s not necessarily the strongest or the most stereotypical male model, he does get attention of ladies using his natural charm. Oftentimes he’s carrying himself in a confident, cocky manner – sometimes just to annoy people like Dora and Ben but no one can deny him his naturally likeableness which he mostly puts on in professional settings&hellip;to his friends he’s kind of an a-hole at times.</p>
<p>His style can be best described as business casual adventurer. He wears slim fit dress shirts of a decent quality paired with more casual pants (also slim cut) over which he has a short coat – also fitted, to compliment his figure and sometimes additional short, hooded cloak to hide his identity. Overall, the priority is elegance &amp; practicality.</p>
<p>Julian’s quite pale and slim, which may not be a result of a fast metabolism but more so his debatable lifestyle choices. Ranging from insomnia and lack of eating to the occasional drug abuse and finally, overextending his magic abilities quite often. For this, he’s received a handful of “you look like a zombie” comments over the years. His face is quite slim as well and he has prominent cheekbones, but doesn’t look outright skeleton-y, he’s actually very charismatic. His hair is slightly wavy, but not noticeably. He has a mid-length shaggy haircut (longer back, shorter front with somewhat of a fringe parted in the middle) - sometimes called “surfer hair” except he’s not blond but brunet.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Almost encyclopaedic knowledge at times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weapons of Choice:</strong> Carries around a sword at times but heavily relies on magic most of the time</p>

<h2 id="character-arc-within-the-main-story">Character Arc within the main story</h2>
<p>Dora first met Julian through his brother Benedict. Together, along with Ben’s criminal “organisation” called The Cult (which has 4 members), they successfully staged a caper and managed to rob the royal treasury.</p>
<p>After that Dora and Julian formed an unlikely alliance, sometimes working together, sometimes working against each other. With The Cult, they faced Carter, the main antagonist, powerful sorcerer also the most confusing character of them all&hellip;very dangerous man indeed.</p>
<p>Over the years Dora and Julian have found themselves in various situations, which strengthened their bond (although neither of them would admit that), they were imprisoned and then escaped Shinkanai Mafia, have both taken part of a larger journey along with other character, Leon Shelton to avert the ending of the world and find out the true purpose of Kharí Alemaam (see Leon Shelton for more details) and many more endeavours.</p>
