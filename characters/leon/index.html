His mother Elisa Hemrey, was of Elven descent, born and raised in Death&rsquo;s Door, moved to Infinitium at age 24, where she met Leon&rsquo;s father Edgar Shelton (also known as Shadow and Edgar Timothy Bradbury) at an art auction (she was an excellent artist). Leon had really good relationship with his mother but his father was cold and distant to him since he was born. He was obssesed his work (trying to get back to his timeline), thus neglecting Leon. Leon inherited his magic powers from his father, but he always dreamt of being an alchemist or an inventor of some sorts. He accomplished this dream at age of 20, when he started officialy working in Shelton Industries as a chemist. He&rsquo;s now the vice CEO, but he mostly tinkers with stuff in the lab and hates all the formal meetings.</p><p>8 years ago (age 15) he&rsquo;s been in an accident. The whole family went every year on holidays in Fallholt. Normally Edgar teleported the whole family but he was out of spell slots and Elisa suggested they can go through the Forbidden forest, like an adventure. Edgar thought it ridiculous but both Elisa and Leon were excited so he allowed it. During the trip Leon got lost and found the Well of Knowledge. He looked inside and someone pushed him over the edge (to this day he still doesn&rsquo;t know who it was). They found him 5 days later laying in front of the forest and claiming he doesn&rsquo;t remember a thing. Not long after this incident he started having prophetic dreams.</p><hr><h2 id=psychology>Psychology</h2><h3 id=personality>Personality</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Core Traits:</strong> Happy-go-lucky, Optimistic, Paranoid, Friendly but Reserved</p></li><li><p><strong>Key Motivations:</strong></p></li></ul><h3 id=relationships>Relationships</h3><p><em>&ldquo;She’s a friend.
