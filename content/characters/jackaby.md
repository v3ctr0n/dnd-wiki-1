## Biography

Jackaby grew up in a travelling village called Still a Living Meadow. It seems he has been kidnapped as a baby along with some other kids and was held captive until the age of 6. Then he was taken away by social workers and spent most of his teenage years in an orphanage. Because of his strange ability and at times downright psychotic behaviour, he was admitted into different asylums multiple times, where he also was experimented on. At 16 he was placed into the Londinium Asylum for the criminally insane. He managed to escape for good when he was 17 with his roommate Elias. Nowdays he's known as "the fast thief", and his name is known all around the L-I continent, although no one has actually seen him in person.

### ADHD, Cleptomania and PTSD

Given the nature of his abilities and history Jackaby suffers from several mental health issues. He seems to exhibit
clear ADHD traits, mainly showcased through his constant impulsivity, hyperactivity, and lowered focus. His impulsivity also plays into his cleptomania - 
Jackaby's house is full of stolen items of the same kind, he "collects" all kinds of items ranging from every possible tea kind
to hats and books. While the rooms are ironically enough, ordered; all walls are filled with things stuffed into shelves from top to bottom, it's clear he has a hoarding problem. It's hard to say the exact causes of this behaviour, it's probably the result of 
his ADHD & unstable childhood. 

Jackaby also suffers from PTSD from his time at the asylum. He rarely talks about his inner thoughts with anyone, so one can only
guess what's going on in his mind. He seems to have hard time letting go of past relationships of any kind even when they are toxic.

## Appearance  

 

### Physical Appearance

Jackaby is on the taller side as far as L-I continent is concerned. He's slim but athletic, doesn't neccesarily work out but his physique benefits from him running all day long at impossible speeds. 

He usually wears a long grey ragged coat with two sets of buttons which he rarely ever closes. He usually just throws it on to make use of the giant pockets on the sides.
